A website for a local science museum. 
My first semester project. 

## Description

This project reflects my creative and technical knowledge and skills based on what I learned during my first semester studying front-end development.  

The target audience is primary and middle school children (7-15) and families with young children. The website is designed to appeal to the target audience: bright colors, big images, and font sizes.
